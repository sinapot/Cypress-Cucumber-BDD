#### Cypress-Cucumber-BDD
This is my Cypress Cucumber BDD framework where I explore and test Cypress BDD capabilities. This is a living code and will grow as I add more test cases that showcases Playwright capabilities.

##This framework uses below dependency:
  -badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
  -cypress/webpack-preprocessor
  
**Continous Integration for this repo uses Github Actions CI**
**This Cucumber framework implements Page Object Design pattern**
**Cypress features implemented in this framewok are:**
 -cy.session()
 -cy.get()
 -cy.contains()
 -cy.type()
 -cy.click()
 -cy.url()
 -cy.find()
